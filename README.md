NCE_MCA classification model
==================

Negative Correlation Enhanced Multiple Correspondence Analysis(NCE_MCA) Classification Model is a classification model utilized negative correlation among concepts to enhanced the Multiple Correspondence Analysis model to classify concepts.The model mainly builds on Matlab, however,the MCA algorithm is implemented in JAVA. 

Structure
